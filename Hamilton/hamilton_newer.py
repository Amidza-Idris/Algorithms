# Basic explanation of Hamilton path and cycle:
"""
Hamilton path - use each node at most once. (You can use the same edge multiple times, this applies to the cycle)
Hamilton cycle - make a full circle to the beggining node AND use each node at most once.
"""
# Usual approach to the problem would be to generate all possible paths and check if any of them satisfy given conditions,
# however that is stupid, I can do it better.


# Perform backtracking to check for paths. This is the backbone of the entire code. It is very hard to explain in a comment
# but here is a basic rundown:
"""
there are 4 variables: 
--- GRAPH (your dict graph), 
--- PATH (initialized in function is_cycle and  is_path [0, -1, -1...]), 
--- POS which is the sequential position of the path to take (the code trials and errors it's way to the correct path and in the 
is_hamilton function if it took the wrong path it will return to the previous node to see if it has other connections to 
it, if not it will go even more back... you get the point) and finally 
--- START which represents the starting node (the first key in your graph dict is initialized as start at the beggining)

# Example usage:
# NOTES: There was a bug where if you didnt put dict's keys in indexing order (0, 1, 2, 3) the code wouldn't work.
# I have fixed it now, I think :)
# ALSO, i used the same graphs from euler to test hamilton, so if you want a visual representation you can go to Euler/Euler paths.png
